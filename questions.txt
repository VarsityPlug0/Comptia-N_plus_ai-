<373><372><371><370><369>A network administrator is notified that a user cannot access resources on the network. The network administrator checks the physical connections to the workstation labeled User 3 and sees the Ethernet is properly connected. However, th</369>e network interface's indicator lights </370>are not blinking on either the computer or the switc</371>h. Which of the following is the</372> most likely cause</373>?

A. The switch failed.
B. The default gateway is wrong.
C. The port is shut down.
D. The VLAN assignment is incorrect.

Answer: C
Explanation:
When a network interface's indicator lights are not blinking on either the computer or the switch, it suggests a physical layer issue. Here is the detailed reasoning:

Ethernet Properly Connected: The Ethernet cable is correctly connected, eliminating issues related to a loose or faulty cable.
No Indicator Lights: The absence of blinking indicator lights on both the computer and the switch typically points to the port being administratively shut down.
Switch Port Shut Down: In networking, a switch port can be administratively shut down, disabling it from passing any traffic. This state is configured by network administrators and can be verified and changed using the command-line interface (CLI) of the switch.

Command to Check and Enable Port:

Bash
Switch> enable
Switch# configure terminal
Switch(config)# interface [interface id]
Switch(config-if)# no shutdown
The command no shutdown re-enables the interface if it was previously disabled. This will restore the link and the indicator lights should start blinking, showing activity.

Privileged Access: The statement "Data can be accessed after privileged access is granted" aligns with the confidentiality principle, as it restricts data access to users who have been granted specific permissions or roles. Only those with the appropriate credentials or permissions can access the data.

**QUESTION 4**

A network engineer performed a migration to a new mail server. The engineer changed the MX record, verified the change was accurate, and confirmed the new mail server was reachable via the IP address in the A record. However, users are not receiving email. Which of the following should the engineer have done to prevent the issue from occurring?

A. Change the email client configuration to match the MX record.  
B. Reduce the TTL record prior to the MX record change.  
C. Perform a DNS zone transfer prior to the MX record change.  
D. Update the NS record to reflect the IP address change.

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

**TTL (Time to Live):**  
Understanding TTL  
TTL is a value in a DNS record that tells how long that record should be cached by DNS servers and clients. A higher TTL value means that the record will be cached longer, reducing the load on the DNS server but delaying the propagation of changes.

**Impact of TTL on DNS Changes:**  
When an MX record change is made, it may take time for the change to propagate across all DNS servers due to the TTL setting. If the TTL is high, old DNS information might still be cached, leading to email being directed to the old server.

**Best Practice Before Making DNS Changes:**  
To ensure that DNS records propagate quickly, it is recommended to reduce the TTL value to a lower value (such as 300 seconds or 5 minutes) well in advance of making the changes. This ensures that any cached records will expire quickly, and the new records will be used sooner.

**Verification of DNS Changes:**  
After reducing the TTL and making the change to the MX record, it is important to verify the propagation using tools like dig or nslookup.

QUESTION 119
Which of the following network cables involves bouncing light off protective cladding?

A. Twinaxial
B. Coaxial
C. Single-mode
D. Multimode

Answer: D

Explanation:
Multimode fiber optic cables involve the transmission of light signals that bounce off the core's cladding as they travel down the fiber. This characteristic differentiates it from single-mode fiber, where the light travels directly down the fiber without reflecting off the cladding. Here are some details about multimode fiber cables:
Construction: Multimode fibers have a larger core diameter, typically 50 or 62.5 microns, compared to single-mode fibers, which have a core of about 9 microns.
Light Propagation: The larger core of multimode fiber allows multiple light modes to propagate. These modes travel at different angles, leading to reflections off the core-cladding boundary.
Distance and Bandwidth: Due to modal dispersion, where different light modes arrive at the receiver at different times, multimode fibers are suited for shorter distance applications compared to single-mode fibers. Typical distances are up to 550 meters for 10 Gbps Ethernet using OM4 multimode fiber.
Applications: Multimode fibers are commonly used in LANs (Local Area Networks), data centers, and for shorter distance data transmission due to their cost-effectiveness and ease of installation.

A security engineer is trying to connect 12 cameras to a 12-port PoE switch, but only eight cameras turn on. Which of the following should the engineer check first?
A. Ethernet cable type
B. Voltage
C. Transceiver
D. DHCP compatibility
Answer: B
Explanation:
Power over Ethernet (PoE) allows devices such as cameras, access points, and VoIP phones to receive both power and data over the same Ethernet cable. The most likely issue is that the PoE switch has exceeded its power output (total wattage budget). PoE Budget Limitation: PoE switches have a maximum power output, which can limit the number of devices they support simultaneously. 802.3af (PoE): Supplies up to 15.4W per port. 802.3at (PoE+): Supplies up to 30W per port.

If not configured correctly, critical services like video may not get the necessary bandwidth and prioritization. Network Congestion: Video services consume large amounts of bandwidth; if the network doesn't have sufficient bandwidth or isn't segmented properly, congestion will slow down all services.


QUESTION 351
A network engineer configures the network settings in a new server as follows:
IP address: 192.163.1.15
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.163.1.255

The server can reach other hosts on the same subnet successfully, but it cannot reach hosts on different subnets. Which of the following is most likely configured incorrectly?
A. Subnet mask
B. Gateway
C. Default route
D. IP address
Answer: B
Explanation:
The default gateway for a network should be an IP address within the subnet, but not the broadcast address. In this case: IP: 192.163.1.15 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 This means the network range is 192.163.1.0 - 192.163.1.255. The broadcast address is 192.163.1.255. Hence, the device fails to communicate outside this subnet because it is trying to use a broadcast address as its gateway. The issue is clearly with the gateway configuration.

QUESTION 352
Which of the following is the part of a disaster recovery (DR) plan that identifies the critical systems that should be recovered first after an incident?
A. RTO
B. SLA
C. MTBF
D. SIEM
Answer: A
Explanation:
RTO stands for Recovery Time Objective, which defines the maximum acceptable amount of time that a system, application, or function can be down after a failure or disaster. It helps prioritize which systems need to be recovered first based on their importance to business operations. SLA (Service Level Agreement) is a contract regarding expected performance and availability, but it does not dictate recovery order. SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a centralized tool for logging and alerting but is not relevant to DR recovery prioritization.

QUESTION 353
Which of the following routing protocols needs to have an autonomous system set in order to establish communication with neighbor devices?
A. OSPF
B. EIGRP
C. FHRP
D. RIP
Answer: B
Explanation:
EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) is a Cisco proprietary advanced distance-vector routing protocol that requires AS numbers to be configured for routers to recognize each other as EIGRP neighbors. OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) does not require autonomous system numbers and routers must be in the same area to form adjacencies. RIP (Routing Information Protocol) does not use autonomous system numbers. FHRP (First Hop Redundancy Protocol) is not a routing protocol but a group of protocols (e.g., HSRP, VRRP) to ensure high availability at the default gateway.

Answer: D
Explanation:
Fax machines use analog phone lines, which are connected using RJ11 connectors. These are standard telephone service (POTS) lines. F-type is used for coaxial cables and cable modems. RJ45 is used for Ethernet network cables. SC (Subscriber Connector) is used for fiber optic connections, not analog telephone lines.

QUESTION 355
Which of the following is the best VPN to use for reducing data bandwidth requirements of the corporate network?
A. Split-tunnel
B. Site-to-site
C. Full-tunnel
D. GRE tunnel
Answer: A
Explanation:
A split-tunnel VPN allows a device to route some traffic through the VPN tunnel while sending other traffic (like general internet browsing) directly to the local corporate network. This reduces the load on the corporate gateway and reduces bandwidth usage at the corporate network. Full-tunnel VPNs route all traffic through the VPN, increasing bandwidth usage. GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) is a tunneling protocol that doesn't encrypt and doesn't reduce bandwidth usage by itself.

If the IP phone works but the workstation doesn't, it indicates that the Voice VLAN is functioning correctly, but the Data VLAN (C) is either misconfigured or missing. The workstation typically connects through the phone, which tags voice and data traffic separately using VLANs.

QUESTION 362
A network engineer is troubleshooting connectivity for a newly installed server on an existing VLAN. The engineer runs the following requested output:
C:\>ipconfig
IP Address: 192.168.100.225
Mask: 255.255.255.224
Gateway: 192.168.100.254

The engineer then logs into the router and runs the following:
Router# show ip route
Codes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP derived, O - OSPF derived,
       B - BGP derived, * - candidate default route, IA - OSPF inter area routed,
       E1 - OSPF external type 1 route, E2 - OSPF external type 2 route,
       Gateway of last resort is not set
C    192.168.100.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/0/2

Which of the following describes the issue?
A. The server has an incorrect subnet mask
B. There is a duplicate IP address on the network
C. The DHCP address pool is exhausted
D. The router is missing a default route
Answer: A
Explanation:
The server's subnet mask is 255.255.255.224 (/27), which covers IPs from 192.168.100.224 to 192.168.100.255. However, the router only recognizes 192.168.100.0/24, indicating a mismatch between the server's subnet and the router's network. Correct mask for /24 is 255.255.255.0, allowing IPs from 192.168.100.0 to 192.168.100.255. This mismatch would result in routing issues, especially with the gateway outside the subnet range.

Which of the following is the most cost-effective way for a network administrator to establish a persistent, secure connection between two facilities?
A. Site-to-site VPN
B. GRE tunnel
C. VXLAN
D. Dedicated line
Answer: A
Explanation:
A site-to-site VPN uses the public internet to create a secure and encrypted connection between two locations. It is persistent, scalable, and far more cost-effective than a dedicated line. GRE tunnel provides tunneling but lacks native encryption and is less secure unless combined with IPsec. VXLAN is used for extending Layer 2 networks over Layer 3, mainly in data centers, and is not cost-focused. A dedicated line is secure but expensive compared to VPNs.

QUESTION 379
A network technician sets up a computer on the accounting department floor for a user from the marketing department. The user reports that they cannot access the marketing department's shared drives but can access the internet. Which of the following is the most likely cause?
A. Mismatched switchport duplex
B. Misconfigured gateway
C. Incorrect VLAN assignment
D. Incorrect SVI is assigned to the wrong IP address
Answer: C
Explanation:
If the user can access the internet but not department-specific resources, it's likely due to being placed in the wrong VLAN instead of the marketing VLAN. It won't have access to marketing's shared drives. Mismatched switchport duplex would cause performance issues, not specific access problems. Misconfigured gateway settings would likely also affect internet access. Incorrect SVI could affect routing, but the internet access working points to VLAN issue.

Explanation:
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is used to prevent network loops in a Layer 2 network, especially when multiple redundant links are created. Link aggregation (e.g., LACP) combines multiple physical links between switches into one logical link to increase throughput and provide failover capabilities. STP allows for automatic failover while keeping the network topology loop-free and preventing broadcast storms in case one of the links goes down, ensuring loop-free stability.

QUESTION 387
Some of the 20 employees who use the wireless network report they are unable to access network resources even though the wireless network is available. An administrator recently made the following configuration changes to the wireless DHCP server:

Network: 192.168.100.0
Mask: 255.255.255.240
Gateway: 192.168.100.1

Which of the following is the cause of this issue?
A. Incorrect VLAN assignment
B. Incorrect ACL configuration
C. Incorrect subnet mask
D. Incorrect default gateway
Answer: C
Explanation:
The subnet mask 255.255.255.240 allows for only 14 usable host IP addresses per subnet (since 2 IP addresses are reserved for network and broadcast addresses), but the administrator has 20 users. With only 14 usable IPs, not enough addresses are available for all users to get a valid IP. To accommodate 20 devices, a subnet mask of 255.255.255.224 (which provides 30 usable IP addresses) should have been used instead.

QUESTION 388

Which of the following is the OSI model layer that uses a connectionless protocol for packet delivery?
A. Physical
B. Network
C. Transport
D. Application
Answer: B
Explanation:
The Network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model uses a connectionless protocol for packet delivery. The most common protocol at this layer is IP (Internet Protocol), which is connectionless. It sends packets between the sender and receiver without establishing a dedicated connection. Higher layers, such as the Transport layer, handle responsibilities like guaranteed delivery or error checking.

QUESTION 390
Which of the following are benefits of implementing MFA and SSO in an enterprise environment? (Choose two.)
A. Eliminating the number of password resets
B. Centralizing user account management activities
C. Adding an extra layer of security against compromised credentials
D. Reducing the overhead of security tokens
E. Leveraging threat feed access policies from external sources
Answer: BC
Explanation:
Centralizing user account management activities: SSO (Single Sign-On) allows users to authenticate once and access multiple applications. This simplifies the complexity of managing multiple user accounts for different systems. Adding an extra layer of security against compromised credentials: MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) requires users to provide something they know (e.g., password) and something they have (e.g., token), making it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.

QUESTION 391
Users report connectivity issues after a network switch is replaced. There are three separate subnets for users, voice, and servers. The users cannot reach the resources in the server subnet, but no users report issues making or receiving voice calls. Which of the following is most likely the issue?
A. Incorrect cable disabled
B. Port security disabled
C. VLAN misconfiguration
D. Duplex misconfiguration
Answer: C
Explanation:
Since users cannot reach resources in the server subnet and this occurred after a switch replacement, the most likely cause is a VLAN misconfiguration. The new switch is not properly configured to allow traffic between VLANs for users and servers. Voice calls are unaffected, suggesting QoS is working, but unnecessary traffic is being dropped due to VLAN tagging issues or misconfigured inter-VLAN routing.

QUESTION 480
An employee has a new laptop and reports slow performance when using the wireless network. Switch firmware was updated the previous night. A network administrator logs in to the switch and reports the following statistics on the switch interface:
Received 98469 packets input, 161937 bytes, 0 no buffer
Received 1548 broadcasts, 0 runts, 0 giants, 0 throttles
11546 input errors, 5 CRC, 0 frame, 0 overrun, 0 ignored
0 input packets with dribble condition detected
0 output errors, 89920 collisions, 0 interface resets
0 output buffer failures, 0 output buffers swapped out
Which of the following is most likely the cause of the issue?
A. The patch cord from the wall jack is faulty
B. The switchport bandwidth needs to be increased
C. Multicast is not configured correctly on the switch
D. The NIC is set to half duplex on the switch
Answer: D
Explanation:
The switch interface shows 89,920 collisions, which is a strong indicator of a duplex mismatch. This typically occurs when one end of the connection (in this case, the NIC in the employee's laptop) is set to half duplex, while the switch port is operating in full duplex. In half duplex, devices must transmit serially over the line (to be clear before transmitting), which leads to collisions and degraded performance. Faulty patch cords often result in CRC errors or physical link problems, not high collisions. Multicast misconfiguration would affect group traffic, not cause collisions on a single port. So the most likely diagnosis is duplex mismatch.

Answer: C
Explanation:
Equipment that uses port-side exhaust (exhausts hot air from the same side as the ports) should be oriented so that the hot air is directed into the warm aisle. Data centers and IDFs are typically arranged in hot aisle/cold aisle configurations to manage airflow and cooling efficiently. The warm aisle is where hot air is expelled, allowing cooling systems to function effectively. Patch panels do not generate significant heat. The front of the IDF may be part of the cold aisle and is not the hot air exhaust location. Correct thermal orientation is crucial for preventing overheating.
QUESTION 482

A company uses a solution to rotate the passwords that engineers use to connect to critical systems. Which of the following best describes this solution?
A. Network access control
B. TACACS+
C. Key management
D. Multifactor authentication
Answer: C
Explanation:
Key management involves the creation, distribution, rotation, and revocation of credentials such as passwords, encryption keys, and certificates. A solution that rotates passwords for critical access is performing a key management function.
Network access control (NAC) controls device access to a network, not password rotation.
TACACS+ is an authentication protocol used to validate users, not manage or rotate passwords.
Multifactor authentication (MFA) adds identity verification factors but does not rotate passwords.

A server administrator needs to add a record to the company's DNS server to verify ownership of a web domain. The administrator has the record's name and value. Which of the following record types should the administrator use to add the record to the DNS server?
A. TXT
B. A
C. PTR
D. CNAME
Answer: A
Explanation:
A TXT (Text) record is used in DNS to store arbitrary text, including information for domain ownership verification (such as those required by SSL certificate authorities, email validation (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), or other uses).
An A (Address) record maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
PTR (Pointer) record maps an IP address (used in reverse DNS lookups).
CNAME (Canonical Name) record creates an alias to another domain name.
To verify domain ownership, the administrator should use a TXT record.

QUESTION 489
A network technician is troubleshooting the connection to the company website. The tracert command produces the following output:
tracert www.mysite.com
1 10.1.1.1 <1 ms <1 ms <1 ms
2 * * * Request timed out.
3 * * * Request timed out.
...
Trace complete
Which of the following should the technician do to identify the path to the server?
A. Review the router's ACL
B. Execute netstat
C. Perform an nslookup
D. Enable LLDP
Answer: A
Explanation:
The tracert output shows that the first hop (10.1.1.1) responds, but subsequent hops show only asterisks (* * *), meaning no response was received from those hops. This typically occurs when routers in the path block ICMP "Time Exceeded" messages, which traceroute relies on. The most likely cause is a router's Access Control List (ACL) blocking ICMP traffic in the path. Reviewing the router's ACL is the appropriate next step to troubleshoot the traceroute issue.
netstat displays active connections and listening ports locally, not network path.
nslookup checks DNS resolution, not network path.
LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) is used in MPLS networks and not relevant here.
QUESTION 490
A major natural disaster strikes a company's headquarters, causing significant destruction and data loss. The company needs to quickly resume operations. Which of the following should the network administrator do first? (Choose two)
A. Conduct a damage assessment
B. Migrate to the cold site
C. Notify customers of the disaster
D. Establish a communication plan
Answer: A
Explanation:
The first step after a disaster is to assess the extent of the damage to systems, infrastructure, and data. This helps determine the next course of action—such as whether to failover to a backup site, begin recovery, or escalate further.
Migrating to the cold site comes after confirming the primary site is unusable.
Notifying customers is important but operational recovery comes first.
Establishing a communication plan should already exist in the disaster recovery plan and is not the first step post-disaster.
Damage assessment is essential to make informed decisions on recovery.
QUESTION 491
After installing a new wireless access point, an engineer tests the device and sees that it is not performing at rated speeds. Which of the following should the engineer do to troubleshoot the issue? (Choose two)
A. Ensure the bottleneck is not coming from other devices on the network
B. Install the latest firmware for the device
C. Create a new VLAN for the access point
D. Make sure the SSID is no longer 16 characters
E. Configure the AP in autonomous mode
F. Install a wireless LAN controller
Answer: A B
Explanation:
Network performance can be affected by congestion or bottlenecks elsewhere, even if the AP itself is functioning correctly. Updating to the latest firmware often resolves performance, compatibility, or bug fix issues.
Creating a new VLAN helps with segmentation but does not directly improve speed performance.
SSID length has no direct impact on speed.
Autonomous mode vs. controller-based depends on design—switching modes is not a direct fix for poor performance.
Best actions to troubleshoot poor wireless performance: check for network bottlenecks and update firmware.
QUESTION 492
After a recent corporate merger, a network administrator needs to build reference documentation on multivendor infrastructure. Which of the following protocols will provide the information?
A. ICMP
B. CDP
C. LLDP
D. SIP
Answer: C
Explanation:
LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) is a vendor-neutral protocol used to advertise identity, capabilities, and neighbors on a local network, making it ideal for documenting multivendor environments.
ICMP is used for network diagnostics (e.g., ping), not device discovery.
CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol) is Cisco proprietary and not suitable for multivendor networks.
SIP is a signaling protocol used in VoIP, unrelated to infrastructure documentation.
LLDP is the correct choice for discovering and documenting multivendor network infrastructure.
QUESTION 493

Explanation:
Identifying the problem is the first step in the troubleshooting methodology and often involves communicating with the user who reported the issue to gather symptoms, context, and details of the problem. Opening a ticket typically occurs during problem identification.
QUESTION 494
A network administrator is hosting a local application on a Type 2 hypervisor, but the application can only be accessed from the host machine. Which of the following address types would the administrator most likely use to access the application?
A. Public
B. Loopback
C. Private
D. APIPA
Answer: B
Explanation:
When an application is hosted locally and accessible only from the host machine, it is typically accessed via the loopback address (127.0.0.1).
Public addresses are routable on the internet and would allow external access—not applicable here.
Private addresses are for internal network communication but can be accessed by other devices on the same network—not just the host.
APIPA addresses (169.254.x.x) are automatically assigned when DHCP fails and are not used for intentional host-only access.
The administrator would most likely use the loopback address to access the local-only application.

QUESTION 495
A network connects two switches together and uses two connecting links. Which of the following configurations will prevent Layer 2 loops?
A. 802.1Q tagging
B. Full aggregation
C. Link aggregation
D. QoS
Answer: C
Explanation:
Link aggregation (e.g., LACP – Link Aggregation Control Protocol) combines multiple physical links into a single logical link. This prevents Layer 2 loops by treating the aggregated links as one logical connection, ensuring loop-free redundancy and increased bandwidth.
802.1Q tagging is for VLAN identification, not loop prevention. Full duplex affects data transmission mode, not topology loops. QoS (Quality of Service) prioritizes traffic types but does not address Layer 2 loops.
Link aggregation is the correct configuration to prevent Layer 2 loops when using multiple links between switches.
QUESTION 496
Which of the following remote connectivity methods is used when data and management traffic use the same network infrastructure?
A. In-band
B. Native VLAN
C. Full-tunnel
D. Site-to-site
Answer: A
Explanation:
In-band management means management traffic shares the same network as regular data traffic. This is common but can pose risks if not properly segmented.
Native VLAN is a VLAN configuration detail, not a remote connectivity method. Full-tunnel refers to VPN configurations where all traffic (including internet-bound) passes through the VPN. Site-to-site is a VPN type for connecting networks, not specifically about management traffic.
In-band is the correct term for using the same network for data and management.

C. Document findings.
D. Test the theory.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Verifying full system functionality occurs after implementing a fix. This step ensures the solution resolved the issue and performance is back to expected levels. Comparing current throughput/performance against a baseline (validation testing) is part of this step to confirm everything is within normal operational parameters.
QUESTION 498
Which of the following uses the longest prefix match to determine an exit interface?
A. ARP table
B. MAC address table
C. Routing table
D. Netstat table
Answer: C
Explanation:
A routing table uses the longest prefix match (most specific subnet mask) to determine the best path and exit interface for forwarding IP packets.
ARP table maps IP addresses to MAC addresses for local forwarding, not route selection.
MAC address table is used by switches to forward frames based on MAC addresses.
Netstat table shows active connections and listening ports, not used for routing decisions.
Longest prefix match is a routing principle applied within the routing table.
QUESTION 499
A network administrator needs to securely connect to an Ubuntu server for management purposes. Which of the following protocols will most likely address this requirement?

QUESTION 500
Which of the following allows for interactive, secure remote management of a network infrastructure device?
A. SSH
B. VNC
C. RDP
D. SNMP
Answer: A
Explanation:
SSH (Secure Shell) provides interactive, secure remote command-line access to network devices (e.g., switches, routers, firewalls). It is widely used for remote management in network infrastructure.
VNC provides graphical remote access but is not typically used for network devices.
RDP is used for GUI-based access to Windows systems, not for network devices.
SNMP is used for monitoring and managing network devices, not for interactive sessions.
SSH is the best choice for interactive and secure remote management of network infrastructure.
QUESTION 501
After a recent security awareness phishing campaign, the cybersecurity team discovers that additional security measures need to be set up to prevent users from accessing potentially malicious websites. Which of the following best addresses this concern?
A. Implement DNS filtering
B. Update ACLs to only allow HTTPS
C. Configure new IPS hardware
D. Deploy 802.1X security features
Answer: A
Explanation:
DNS filtering blocks access to malicious domains by preventing DNS resolution of known bad sites, stopping users from reaching phishing/malware sites even if they click on harmful links.
Updating ACLs to only allow HTTPS does not stop phishing (malicious HTTPS sites still resolve).
IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) helps with network-level threats but may not directly prevent web-based phishing/port-level filtering.
802.1X controls network access at the port level, not web filtering.
DNS filtering is the most effective and targeted measure to prevent access to malicious websites.
QUESTION 502
During a security audit, a consulting firm notices inconsistencies between the documentation and the environment. Which of the following can keep a record of who made the changes and what the changes are?
A. Network access control
B. Configuration monitoring

Configuration monitoring and management tools (often part of network management systems) maintain version-controlled records of device configurations, track changes, and log who made them. This provides accountability and supports compliance audits.
QUESTION 503
Which of the following describes a malicious application that takes advantage of a software flaw?
A. Risk
B. Vulnerability
C. Exploit
D. Threat
Answer: C
Explanation:
An exploit is a malicious application or code that takes advantage of a vulnerability (a flaw or weakness) in software to perform unauthorized actions or cause harm.
Risk is the potential for loss or damage.
Vulnerability is the flaw or weakness that could be exploited.
Threat is the potential attack or event that abuses the vulnerability.
The exploit is the actual attack mechanism that abuses the vulnerability.
QUESTION 504
Which of the following allows a standard user to log in to multiple resources with one account?
A. RADIUS
B. MFA
C. TACACS+
D. SSO
Answer: D
Explanation:
SSO (Single Sign-On) allows a user to authenticate once and gain access to multiple systems or applications without needing to log in again for each resource.
RADIUS is a centralized authentication protocol but does not inherently provide single sign-on.
MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) adds additional identity verification factors but does not consolidate logins.
TACACS+ is an authentication protocol used primarily for network devices, not for consolidating logins across applications.
SSO is the correct choice for enabling access to multiple resources with one account login.
QUESTION 505
Which of the following describes the capability of a cloud service to adjust resources on demand?
A. Elasticity
B. Multitenancy
C. Containers
D. Scalability
Answer: A
Explanation:
Elasticity refers to the automatic adjustment of resources on demand (such as compute, memory, or storage) up or down based on load, ensuring efficient resource utilization and cost control.
Multitenancy allows multiple customers to share the same infrastructure securely.
Containers package applications and their dependencies, but they don't inherently adjust resources.
Scalability refers to the ability to grow (manually or automatically), but elasticity specifically describes automatic on-demand adjustment in cloud environments.
QUESTION 506
A company's Chief Information Security Officer requires that servers and firewalls have accurate time stamps for log correlation during investigations. Which of the following should be implemented?
A. Syslog
B. NTP
C. SMTP
D. SNMP
Answer: B
Explanation:
NTP (Network Time Protocol) is used to synchronize the clocks of network devices, such as servers and firewalls, ensuring accurate and consistent timestamps. This is essential for log correlation during security investigations.
Syslog collects logs but does not sync time.
SMTP is for email transmission and unrelated to time synchronization.
SNMP is used for monitoring and managing network devices, not for time sync.
NTP ensures accurate and consistent timestamps, which is critical for log analysis and incident response.

QUESTION 507
Which of the following connector types is most commonly associated with Wi-Fi?
A. BNC
B. SFP
C. MPO
D. RJ45
Answer: A
Explanation:
BNC (Bayonet Neill-Concelman) connectors are commonly used with RF (radio frequency) connections in wireless networks, especially for Wi-Fi antennas.
SFP is used for fiber or Ethernet modules in switches and routers. MPO is a multi-fiber connector for high-density fiber-optic cabling. RJ45 is used for Ethernet cabling, not Wi-Fi antennas.
BNC is the connector type most commonly associated with Wi-Fi antennas.
QUESTION 508
A user recently connected a new computer to the LAN. The user is unable to ping the default gateway. The technician examines the configuration and sees a self-assigned IP address. Which of the following is the most likely cause?
A. The DHCP server is not available
B. An RFC1918 address is being used
C. The TCP/IP stack is disabled
D. A static IP is assigned
Answer: A
Explanation:
A self-assigned IP address (typically in the 169.254.x.x range, also known as an APIPA address) indicates that the computer attempted to obtain an IP address via DHCP but did not receive a response.
If an RFC1918 address (like 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x) was assigned, the system would have proper IP and network functionality. A static IP would not self-assign via APIPA at all.
The most likely cause is that the DHCP server is unavailable.
QUESTION 509
A network technician is attempting to harden a commercial switch that was recently purchased. Which of the following hardening techniques best mitigates the use of publicly available information?
A. Changing the default password
B. Blocking inbound SSH
C. Removing the gateway from the network configuration
D. Restricting physical access to the switch
Answer: A
Explanation:
Changing the default password is one of the most effective and essential hardening steps, as default credentials are widely and publicly available. Leaving them unchanged poses a major security risk.
Blocking inbound SSH might limit remote access but does not specifically address default/public credential risks. Removing the gateway may affect network connectivity but does not harden against credential attacks. Restricting physical access is important, but it doesn’t mitigate risks from publicly known login credentials.
QUESTION 510
A new backup system takes too long to copy files to the NAS and the devices to decrease backup times. A network administrator makes a simple change to the network and the devices. Which of the following does the network administrator change?
A. QoS
B. SDN
C. MTU
D. VXLAN
E. TTL
Answer: C
Explanation:
MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) defines the largest packet size that can be sent over the network without fragmentation. Increasing the MTU allows larger packets (e.g., jumbo frames) to reduce overhead and improve backup transfer speeds.
QoS prioritizes traffic types but doesn’t improve file transfer speed directly. SDN (Software-Defined Networking) is an architectural approach for network virtualization, not backup performance. VXLAN is used for overlay networks. TTL (Time To Live) limits packet lifespan but doesn’t affect transfer speed.
Changing the MTU can significantly decrease backup times by enabling more efficient data transmission.
QUESTION 511
Users are experiencing significant lag while connecting to a cloud-based application during peak hours. An analysis shows that only a few users are using the application at any given time. Which of the following is the most cost-effective solution for this issue?
A. Limit the number of users who can access the application
B. Lease a Direct Connect to the cloud service provider
C. Implement QoS to prioritize application traffic
D. Use a CDN to service the application
Answer: C
Explanation:
QoS (Quality of Service) allows the network administrator to prioritize critical traffic — such as the cloud-based application — over less essential traffic. This ensures that even during high bandwidth usage, essential application traffic maintains acceptable performance.
Limiting users is restrictive and does not address the root cause. Leasing a Direct Connect (or dedicated line) is effective but expensive and not cost-effective for most use cases. A CDN (Content Delivery Network) improves performance for static content, not dynamic cloud applications with congestion issues.
Implementing QoS is the most cost-effective way to reduce lag for prioritized application traffic during congestion.
QUESTION 512
In a company, users report that after walking from one room to another, network connectivity is lost. The SSID is available, but the users have to manually reconnect every time they change rooms. Which of the following is most likely the cause of this issue?
A. Each room has wireless interference
B. There is poor wireless coverage
C. MAC filtering is applied in the WLAN
D. Roaming configuration is disabled
Answer: D
Explanation:
Roaming configuration allows wireless clients to seamlessly switch between access points (APs) without manual reconnection when moving through different coverage areas. If roaming is disabled or not optimized, the SSID remains visible but requires manual reconnection despite changing rooms.
Wireless interference might cause weak signal or dropped packets, but not require manual reconnection. Poor coverage would prevent SSID visibility or cause complete signal loss. MAC filtering restricts access by device MAC address, not by room or roaming behavior.
The described behavior points to roaming configuration being disabled.
QUESTION 513
A network administrator needs to monitor data from recently installed firewalls in multiple locations. Which of the following solutions would best meet the administrator’s needs?
A. IDS
B. IPS
C. SIEM
D. SNMPv2
Answer: C
Explanation:
A SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system collects, aggregates, analyzes, and displays log data from multiple sources — like firewalls in different locations — for centralized monitoring and correlation.
IDS detects malicious activity but is not used for centralized log monitoring. IPS prevents attacks and is not for monitoring event logs. SNMPv2 is used for monitoring device status and performance, not security event analysis or log correlation.
SIEM is the ideal solution for monitoring data from firewalls in multiple locations.
QUESTION 514
Which of the following is an example of a split-tunnel VPN?
A. Only corporate resources are accessed through the VPN tunnel
B. Only public resources are accessed through the user’s internet connection
C. Encrypted and public resources are accessed through separate tunnels
D. ACLs are used to balance network traffic through different connections
Answer: A
Explanation:
A split-tunnel VPN sends only corporate/private traffic through the VPN tunnel, while public/non-corporate traffic goes out directly over the user’s normal internet connection.
QUESTION 515

A. DNS spoofing
B. Phishing
C. VLAN hopping
D. ARP poisoning
Answer: A
Explanation:
When the hosts file is altered, local name resolution is compromised, and domain queries are redirected to malicious IP addresses. This is a form of DNS spoofing/poisoning, where false resolutions trick users into visiting fraudulent websites.
QUESTION 541
Which of the following attacks forces a switch to send all traffic out of all ports?
A. ARP poisoning
B. Evil twin
C. MAC flooding
D. DNS spoofing
Answer: C
Explanation:
MAC flooding overwhelms a switch's CAM (Content Addressable Memory) table by sending spoofed MAC addresses. Once the CAM table overflows, the switch cannot determine legitimate MAC addresses and defaults to sending all traffic out of all ports (acting like a hub). This allows an attacker to capture traffic not originally destined for their port.
QUESTION 542
Which of the following devices functions mainly at the data link layer of the OSI model and is used to connect a fiber-optic cable to a network interface?
A. SC
B. DAC
C. SFP transceiver

Explanation:
The Management Information Base (MIB) defines variables and objects that SNMP can query but cannot interpret the data if the correct MIB is missing. Importing the proper MIB allows the monitoring system to correctly display device status and metrics.
QUESTION 544
Two network switches at different locations are connected via fiber-optic cable at a distance of 10 miles (16 km). The duplex fiber-optic patch cord between the patch panel and switch is broken. The link lights are still on at both ends of all ports. Which of the following actions should the technician perform first?
A. Replace the fiber-optic transceiver in the switch
B. Transpose the fiber-optic patch cord
C. Swap the single-mode fiber patch cord with a multimode fiber patch cord
Answer: B
Explanation:
Fiber connections require Tx on one end to connect to Rx on the other. If the patch cord is reversed (transposed) and link lights remain on, the most common cause is that the connectors are swapped. Swapping (transposing) the connectors restores proper transmit/receive alignment.
QUESTION 545
Users are reporting issues with mobile phone connectivity after a cellular repeater was recently installed. Users also note that the phones are rapidly losing battery charge. Which of the following should the technician check first to troubleshoot the issue?
A. WPS configuration
B. Signal strength
C. Channel frequency
D. Power budget
Answer: B
Explanation:
When signal strength is poor, mobile devices constantly boost transmission power in an attempt to maintain a stable connection. This results in dropped calls/data and rapid battery drain. When a repeater was installed, misalignment or misconfiguration could be degrading the signal strength.

name
interface Ethernet 1/1
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allow vlan 100
interface Ethernet 1/2
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allow vlan 100
interface port-channel 1
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allow vlan 100
Which of the following is the state of the Core-SW01 port-channel interfaces?
A. Incrementing CRC errors
B. Errdisabled
C. Administratively down
D. Suspended
Answer: D
Explanation:
On Core-SW01, the ports are configured with LACP (mode active) for link aggregation. On Core-SW02, the ports are not configured as part of an LACP group. Because of this mismatch, LACP cannot form the bundle, and the aggregated ports on SW01 go into a suspended state.

QUESTION 547
After a security incident, a technician reveals that company data was stolen. During the investigation, it is discovered that a host disguised itself as a switch. Which of the following best describes what occurred?
A. VLAN hopping
B. Evil twin
C. DNS poisoning
D. ARP spoofing
Answer: A
Explanation:
VLAN hopping occurs when an attacker tricks a switch into believing the host is another switch by generating tagged frames, potentially trunk negotiation (DTP) allowing access to multiple VLANs and stealing sensitive data.

A user tries to visit a website, but instead of reaching the intended site, the page displays vmw.cba.com. Which of the following should be done to reach the correct website?
A. Modify the CNAME record
B. Update the PTR record
C. Change the NTP settings
D. Delete the TXT record

A network technician needs to connect a new user to the company's Wi-Fi network called SSID: business. When attempting to connect, two networks are listed as possible choices: SSID: business and SSID: mybusiness. Which of the following attacks is occurring?
A. On-path
B. Rogue AP
C. Evil twin
D. Tailgating
Answer: C
Explanation:
An evil twin attack occurs when an attacker creates a fraudulent AP with an SSID very similar (or identical) to the legitimate one. Users attempting to connect may join the rogue AP, allowing the attacker to capture traffic and credentials.
QUESTION 553
A network administrator receives complaints of intermittent network connectivity issues. The network design contains potential loop scenarios. Which of the following should the administrator do?
A. Enable spanning tree
B. Configure port security
C. Change switchport speed limits
D. Enforce 802.1Q tagging
Answer: A
Explanation:
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is designed to detect and prevent Layer 2 loops by blocking redundant paths. If loops are possible in the design, enabling STP ensures network stability.
QUESTION 554
A network engineer connects a business to a new ISP. A simple ping to 8.8.8.8 is successful. However, users complain of extreme slowness to any website and periods of no connectivity. Which of the following is the most likely cause?
A. Incorrect default gateway
B. VLAN mismatch
C. Subnet mask misconfiguration
D. Duplicate ISP IP address
Answer: D
Explanation:
If the business shares or duplicates the ISP-assigned public IP address, routing instability and conflicts will occur. Pinging a public IP like 8.8.8.8 may succeed (ICMP can bypass certain conflicts), but general web traffic requires stable sessions and will fail intermittently.
QUESTION 555
